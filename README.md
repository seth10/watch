# watch

In late 2014 I wanted to make a watch. Smartwatches were starting to pick up and get some press, but none of the ones on the market fit my needs. Really I just wanted a simple one with a bright, clear display. I suppose it's more of a plain old digital watch, actually, as it won't connect to my phone. See footnote 1.

I didn't make much progress besides getting the components then, it being my senior year of high school and all. But now (mid 2017), I'm getting back into it and really enjoying this project. It's great coming back to it with a greater understanding of nearly every aspect of this project.

The primary hardware components I have are two [Adafruit Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501)s, two [Pro Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000)s ([Hackaday limited edition](store.hackaday.com/products/trinket-pro-with-black-solder-mask-and-the-hackaday-io-logo) :D), one 14-segment [quad-alphanumeric display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1912), and two OLED displays (one [SPI](https://www.banggood.com/0_96-Inch-White-IIC-I2C-OLED-Display-Module-12864-LED-For-Arduino-p-932606.html), one [I2C](https://www.banggood.com/0_96-Inch-I2C-IIC-SPI-Serial-128-x-64-OLED-LCD-LED-Display-Module-p-922246.html)).

*Footnote 1:* Maybe I could use a [Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/feather) [with an ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3404) to make a real "smart" watch.
